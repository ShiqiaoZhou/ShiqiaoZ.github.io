Greetings! I am a master of computing graduate in CECC at the [Austalian National University](https://https://www.anu.edu.au/), advised by [Dr. Melina Vidoni](https://melvidoni.rbind.io/#about). I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/) in 2019, advised by [Researcher. Jun Han](http://www.junlilab.org/). <i>Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position<i>.

I am passionate about a wide range of topics in computer science, including both method development and applications. My current research focuses on realistic modeling of fluxional clusters, restructuring surfaces, and electrochemical interfaces under reaction conditions. I am also interested in inverse design of functional molecules/materials, chemical bonding analysis, global optimization algorithms, and data-driven methods. Please take a look at the "projects" page to learn more about my research and publications!


<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->
