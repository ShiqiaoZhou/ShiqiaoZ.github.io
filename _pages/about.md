<h2 style="font-weight: bolder">About me</h2>
Greetings! I am a fresh graduate of Master of Computing in CECC at the [Australian National University](https://https://www.anu.edu.au/), advised by [Dr. Melina Vidoni](https://melvidoni.rbind.io/#about). I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/) in 2019, advised by Dr. Jun Han and Dr. Yi Ou. 

I am passionate about a wide range of topics in CS, including both method development and applications. My current focuses are on deep leaning methods, down stream NLP tasks and data science. I am also interested in Robotics. Please take a look at the "projects" page to learn more!


<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
