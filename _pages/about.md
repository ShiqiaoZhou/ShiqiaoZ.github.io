Greetings! I am a fresh graduate of master of computing in CECC at the [Austalian National University](https://https://www.anu.edu.au/), advised by [Dr. Melina Vidoni](https://melvidoni.rbind.io/#about). I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://english.njust.edu.cn/) in 2019, advised by Researcher, Jun Han. 
<i>Currently, I am looking for a deep learning related Ph.D. position<i>.

I am passionate about a wide range of topics in computer science, including both method development and applications. My current focuses are on deep leaning methods, down stream NLP tasks and data science. I am also interested in trajectory planning of Robotics. Please take a look at the "projects" page to learn more about my precious experiences!


<!-- - Statistical ensemble representation of dynamic clusters and restructuring surfaces in catalytic conditions.
- Development of global optimizers with grand canonical and multi-objective functionality for structure search of crystals, clusters, and surfaces.
- Realistic modeling of electrocatalytic interface to understand the roles of pH, electrode potential, solvation, and electrolyte additives.
- Direct and inverse design of functional molecules and materials for CO$_2$ capture and electroreduction. -->
