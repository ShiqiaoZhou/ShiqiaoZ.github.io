This an ongoing [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stable-diffusion-image-to-prompts/overview)

The goal of this competition is to reverse the typical direction of a generative text-to-image model: to predict the prompts from the images generated by stable diffusion 2.0.

I am working on trying different models like CLIP and handling with embeddings to solve this question.
