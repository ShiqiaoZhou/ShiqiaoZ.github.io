This an robot project in Chinase Academy of Science, which contained a design competition with TRS-- an OPen-Source recipe for
teachingneaming robotics with a Simulator. 

The project consists in using a mobile robot to pick-up
groceries from a table and move them to different baskets distribued across a house. The project
invoIves control, navigation, maping, vision and manipulation. 

What I did in this project:
•	Built models of manipulator and mobile robot using V-REP, and conducted the communication and simulation 
•	Mastered the methods of simulation modeling and programming control, and controlled the manipulator and mobile robot to perform the assigned actions
•	Completed the extraction and recognition of visual,  allowing the robot to determine which object to grab
•	Conducted the trajectory planning based on the Cartesian space, and converted the continuous map signals into digital signals
