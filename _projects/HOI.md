For Human Object Interaction (HOI) Detection task, One essential perception how to locate the human position, and
combine the human object instances with a specific interaction more effectively. However, the current one-stage HOI
Detection model based on transformer doesnâ€™t give much prior information on HOI locations locations and interaction
classes. 

We proposed a novel HOI grouping block to group the human and objects into a HOI instance  in a more efficient way. To enhance the prediction of HOI action, we fuse the pre-trained verb vectors for all actions in the dataset as linguistic query to help model predicting the interaction type. Finally, we come up with a new two dimensional positional encoding based on two-dimensional fourier series for enhancing the priori location encoding of HOI instances.
