This is a project for Mechinical Design competition which is one of the biggest engineering competions for Chinese university students.

We orignially designed a steerable Fruit Picking Device to help people to pick fruits on the tree. I led the team and these are what we did:

•	Accomplished the overall mechanical structure design which consisted of operating unit, two telescopic rods, picking unit and collection & buffer unit

•	Optimized the structure of picking unit and adopted blade cutting method, improving the picking efficiency

•	Collocated camera and steering engine in picking unit to get more accurate location of fruits

•	Realized the unhurt fruit collection and reduced labor intensity by equipping collection & buffer unit

•	Used Arduino Nano as main controller, designed the hardware circuit part and, wrote the control program

Results: 1st prize award in Provincial & university Mechanical Innovational Design Competition; One Chinese invention patent
